# Configuration file for Repwatcher's server

# Directories you want to watch
# Separate them with a ;
# Example : "/home/ftp";"/home/foo"
directories="/home/ftp"

# Subdirectories you want to ignore but would have been watched otherwise
# Example : "/home/ftp/videos"
# This is optional.
# ignore_directories=""

# Users you don't want to report when they access files
# This is optional.
# ignore_users=""

# There are 2 modes :
# - specified_programs means you want to watch files opened only with those programs
# - unwanted_programs means you want to watch files opened with every programs except those

# specified_programs can't be empty. If you want it empty, please use unwanted_programs and leave it empty
specified_programs="sftp-server";"scp";"proftpd";"gvfsd-sftp";"gvfsd-ftp";"vlc"

# If you leave unwanted_programs blank, it means you want to catch everything

##############################
# Main process configuration part

# For security reasons, it is not recommended to start RW as root. If an attacker exploits a vulnerability, he will
# have the same system rights than the identity running the process. That's why, the process must run with the least
# priviliges possible.

# To do that, you should either run RW like this "sudo -u <other_identity> rw_server"
# or run it as root and let RW drop the identity with another one with lesser privileges in process_identity.
# The main process identity must be able to read in the directory put under surveillance.

# If RW starts as a normal user (not root)
# and you plan on using the network feature for remote notifications
# then the network process will have the same identity than the main_process which may be fine but it would be better
# to have the network process with an identity with lesser privileges as "nobody".

# To have RW running as a normal user and
# have the process in charge of the remote notifications with an identity with lesser privileges,
# then RW must be started as root and have both process_identity and server_process_identity set.

# If you plan on running RW as a normal identity (not root) and do not want to use the remote notifications,
# then the fields process_identity and server_process_identity can be left commented.
# 
# process_identity=""

# The SQL part (optional)

# sql_rdbms must be postgresql or mysql
# sql_rdbms="postgresql"

# sql_login=""
# sql_pswd=""
# sql_host="localhost"

# If left in comment, the default port will be used.
# sql_port=""

# sql_dbname="repwatcher"

##############################
# The notification part
#
# Enter either Y or N (yes or no)
notify_locally="N"

# This one activates the server
notify_remotely="N"

# Number of folders displayed when notifying
# Example: /home/ftp/Videos/2011/holidays.avi
# If notify_parent_folders=2 then you'll be notified with :
# - Videos/2011/holidays.avi
#
# This option can be used for local and remote notifications.
# About the remote notifications, the clients can override this value with the -n argument on the CLI: ./rw_client <host> -n <value>
# notify_parent_folders="2"
###########################


###########################
# Server configuration part (required if notify_remotely is set at Y)

# CA cert required to check the clients' certificate signature
# server_ca_path="CA/CA.crt"
# server_cert_path="cert/rw_serv.crt"
# server_key_path="cert/rw_serv.key"

# Optional, password to unlock the private key.
# This can be done at run time.
# server_key_pwd="soso"

# Optional, default is 9292
# server_port=""

# This option is in case Repwatcher is started as root and is _highly_ recommended !!!
# When starting up, Repwatcher forks to start the remote notifications server.
# The fork identity is then 'root' even though 'process_identity' is set.
# This option drops the identity to take the one you want.
# Please refer to the main process configuration above for some more information.
server_process_identity="nobody"


# Optional, a chroot can be done only if RW is started as root
# server_process_chroot="chroot"

##############################
# The mail part

# If you desire, you could be notified by email
# Please detail what kind of event you're interested in:
# are you interested in the opening event or closing event or both ?
# email_open="N"
# email_close="N"

# If email_open or email_close or both are selected, the following fields need to be filled:
# email_sender_name="Repwatcher"
# email_sender_address="repwatcher@domain.org"

# several recipients can be configured. Example for 2: "recipient1@domain.org";"recipient2@domain.org"
# email_recipients=""

# smtp_host=""
# smtp_port="25" # optional, default is 25. GMail port: 587
# smtp_username="" # optional
# smtp_passwd="" # optional. Must be enabled if smtp_username is
# smtp_ssl="N"
##############################


##############################
# The log part
#
# Optional. If it's commented, it means log_level="0"

# 0 Doesn't log anything (disabled)
# 1 is recommended. Log who accesses what, who gets notified and also errors
# 2 is the most verbose and can be used to debug. Same thing than 1 but also log when folders are created/moved/deleted, SQL queries, ...
log_level="1"
