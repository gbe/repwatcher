You must create this database and table in MySQL:

CREATE DATABASE `repwatcher` ;

CREATE TABLE `repwatcher`.`downloads` (
  `ID` int(4) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `LOGIN` varchar(20) NOT NULL,
  `PROGRAM` varchar(26) NOT NULL,
  `PATH` varchar(512) default NULL,
  `FILENAME` varchar(80) character set utf8 NOT NULL,
  `FILESIZE` varchar(13) default NULL,
  `STARTING_DATE` datetime NOT NULL,
  `ENDING_DATE` datetime default NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`ID`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

To compile : make

To clean the compiled files : make clean



You have to configure the file repwatcher.conf
Repwatcher must be executed as root (or with sudo)

I've already prepared a demonstration file ("demo.txt") to simulate some downloaded files.

To insert into the database the data from the file, you must execute repwatcher like this :
sudo ./repwatcher demo.txt
or sudo ./repwatcher -verbose demo.txt

Otherwise, it's sudo ./repwatcher or sudo ./repwatcher -verbose

I recommend to use the program "screen" to run repwatcher in a virtual terminal.


Don't hesitate to give me some feedbacks.
