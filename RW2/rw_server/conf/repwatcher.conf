# Separate them with a ;
# Example : "/home/ftp";"/home/foo"

# There are 2 modes :
# - specified_programs means you want to watch only these programs
# - unwanted_programs means you don't want to keep a trace of the data used by these programs
mode="specified_programs"

# specified_programs can't be empty. If you want it empty, please use unwanted_programs and leave it empty
specified_programs="sftp-serv";"scp";"proftpd";"gvfsd-sft";"gvfsd-ftp";"vlc"

# If you leave unwanted_programs blank, it means you want to catch everything
